# Izarra Villareal CS 81 JavaScript Module 4 Assignment 4A: Review readingTracker.js

# What was the most helpful aspect of this codeâ€™s structure?
The most helpful aspect of the code's structure was its readability. I was able to read the code and understand how it was working without having to decipher odd naming conventions.

# What part was confusing or took longer to understand?
The only part that was confusing was the first time I tried to do this assignment I ran into so many issues using Git. It turned out to be mistakes on my end. I figured out the process I need to follow and fell into a rhythm of using Git for revision control and documentation.
